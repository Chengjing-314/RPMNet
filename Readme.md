# RPM-Net: Robust Point Matching using Learned Features

![pic-network](docs/network-arch.png)

This is the project webpage of our CVPR 2020 work. RPM-Net is a deep-learning approach designed for performing rigid partial-partial point cloud registration for objects in a iterative fashion. Our paper can be found on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13479).
